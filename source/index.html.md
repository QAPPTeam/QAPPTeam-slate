## Signup endpoints -- researcher

```javascript

let data = { 
                "name": "aname",
                "institution": "an institution",
                "department": "department",

                "email": "an email",
                "password": "a password",
}

//this code registers a researcher
var response = fetch('https://research-stream.herokuapp.com/user/registerResearcher ', {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })

```
>Signup endpoints are different for participants and researcher

This function returns a json of the new user information in the form of the dataResearcher variable and prints this json to the console

HTTP request

* POST https://research-stream.herokuapp.com/user/registerResearcher 

###parameters for researchers
* name
* institution
* department
* address
* country
* phone number
* email
* password

>Signup endpoints are different for participants and researcher

This function returns a json of the new user information in the form of the dataResearcher variable and prints this json to the console

HTTP requests

* POST https://research-stream.herokuapp.com/user/registerParticipant

###parameters for participants
* Name
* age
* city
* phone number
* email
* password

## Login endpoint

```javascript

let data = {
    "email":"sppedster2@gmail.com",
    "password":"password"
}

var response = fetch('http://localhost:5000/user/login ', {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
.then(function(response) {
    console.log(response.text())
    return response.text();
})

```

The User is identified by a unique email
The login endpoint saves a user's unique ID to a session state to that it can be checked before the user accesses other checkpoints.
All the endpoints following this one require the login endpoint to be run first

Login is accessed via the endpoint

* https://research-stream.herokuapp.com/user/login

### login parameters
* email
* password

## logout endpoint
```javascript

var response = fetch('https://research-stream.herokuapp.com/user/login ', {
        method: "GET",
    })
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })

```
This returns a string stateting the user is logged out successfully, there are no parameters, if a user is not logged in the returned string will state this information instead

## User Update Endpoint

>to update a participant different data needs to be used but they are both updates using the same endpoint
```javascript

## get studies by other parameters
>before accessing any of the folloing endpoints login

fetch('https://research-stream.herokuapp.com/study/name/<someName>', {
        method: "GET"
    })
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })

fetch('https://research-stream.herokuapp.com/study/location/<someLocation>', {
        method: "GET"
    })
  .then(function(response) {

# Messageing system instruction
## files
1. dump_from_server.js
2. send_msg.js
3. index.js
4. encryption.js

## how to use it
1. when user open the chat page, set up the user and chatroom
2. add this code in the webpage to trigger socket.io
3. dump_from_server.dump will return the chat history, need to insert it into the web page. 
4. encryption haven't been tested yet



# TODO

1. ~~~Messageing endpoint documentation~~~
3. calander intergration
